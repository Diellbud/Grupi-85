    <h1>The Fall</h1>
    <h2>By:Lovejoy</h2>

<p>Under the weight of a broken nose<br>
It's not that simple, but he won't seem to notice<br>
There must be more to this<br>
So leave those sink estates, and let's book a holiday<br>
We're painting all the counties in blue<br>
'Cause we're already boring, and we're already hoarding<br>
What else have we got left to accrue?<br><br>

<em>And the ramblers will say<br>
    "It's got a marvelous view!"<br>
    But they don't know how many lives it took, no<br>
    Thеy'll never know what you knew<br><br></em>

And the ramblers will say<br>
"It's got a marvelous view!"<br>
But they don't know how many lives it took, no<br>
Thеy'll never know what you knew<br><br>

And wе're so calm, but we're- (Fricking scared, Fricking scared!)<br>
And we're so calm, but we're- (Fricking scared, Fricking scared!)<br>
And we're so calm, but we're- (Fricking scared, Fricking scared!)<br>
And we're so calm, but we're Fricking scared of people like you!<br><br>

Under the weight of some Sertraline<br>
A couple Prozacs, and now I'm pumping dopamine!<br>
There must be more to this<br>
We've got a country house now, old dog has been put down now<br>
It's nice to be around trees<br>
Custom license plate on our Audi R8<br>
How many grocers does one county need?<br><br>

<em>And the ramblers will say<br>
"It's still a marvelous view!"<br>
But that treadmill still looms<br>
With your hedonic misuse<br><br></em>

So come on, one and all and see the apathy!<br>
The reams of grey stencils that fill the tapestry<br>
I look to all of you and see a different fucking species!<br>
Aspiration for a different destination to me<br>
Across the Pennines, there's a thin blue line, a knife and a mall<br>
I would do something if it wasn't all so effortful<br>
'Cause I'm so high, my brain can't even look at the fall<br>
And when you've reached the top, there's nowhere else to go but...<br><br>

*exhale*<br></p>
